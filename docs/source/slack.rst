TODO: Create channels for different topics. 

For example, ‘general’ for a general discussion on topics that can be understanded by all members. 
‘meta learning’ channel for a more specific interest in learning-to-learn. ‘idea-sharing’ for useful information, tools, or simply ideas.

In this initial stage, please feel free to advise channel names.
When do we use it?
